Automated League of Legends Spreadsheet created by Lucas Nagy, he stopped supporting the project in 2023.
I took over the project and modernized it to work with the new Riot ID system and other API changes that made the spreadsheet no longer function.
What the spreadsheet does is track a specific summons gameplay giving more in depth information about your own or someone else's performance.

This is a view link the the results of the scripted, used on my own League of Legends account:
